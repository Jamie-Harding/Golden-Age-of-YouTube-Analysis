# YouTube Golden Age Survey Data

## Data Description

This dataset was collected through a survey designed to explore perceptions of the "Golden Age of YouTube." The survey asked respondents to provide information on the following: - **Gender:** The gender identity of the respondent. - **Year of Birth:** The respondent's year of birth. - **Year Started Watching YouTube Regularly (YSW):** The year the respondent began watching YouTube on a regular basis. - **Perceived Golden Age of YouTube (PGA):** The year or period that the respondent considers to be the "Golden Age" of YouTube.

## Data Format

-   The dataset is provided in CSV format (`results.csv`).
-   Each row represents a single respondent's answers to the survey questions.

## Usage

This data can be used to analyze relationships between age, gender, years spent on YouTube, and perceptions of YouTube's golden age.

## Research Questions

This study is designed to answer the following research questions:

1\. Is there are correlation between the age of respondents and the perceived Golden Age of YouTube?

a\. Which age ranges correlate the most strongly with each PGA?

2\. Is there a correlation between the year respondents started watching YouTube and the perceived Golden Age of YouTube?

a\. Which YSWs correlate the most strongly with each PGA?

3\. Does birth year correlate more strongly to PGA than the year the person started watching YouTube?

4\. Is there any difference in PGA correlations with birth year and YSW between genders?

## Methods

We'll use Pearson's Correlation formula to determine correlations. We will then do a residual analysis to ensure this model is appropriate. Finally, we will use Z-tests to determine if there is any difference between PGA correlations with birth year and YSW between genders.
